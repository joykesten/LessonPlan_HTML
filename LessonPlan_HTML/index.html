            <h4>Lesson Overview:</h4>

            <p>Writing code is a series of instructions, organized in a structure. Students will follow the instructions in the <em>Treehouse Club - HTML</em> videos and in their Workspace to complete the structure with their information and story. At the end of the lesson, students should be able to publish a story they’ve written in a (completely private and non sharable) web browser using Workspaces.</p>

            <p>To accomplish this they are going to use a special programming language called HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language. Students will be given everything necessary to publish their story in the Workspace, the student’s job it to edit the content in the template.</p>

            <p>Below is an example of how to write HTML code. <p>

            <h4>Background and Information:</h4>
            
            <p>HTML is one of the most commonly used web development languages used around the world. HTML describes the structure of a website along with cues for presentation, which is why it’s considered a “markup language” rather than a “programming language”. HTML is built on elements, consisting of tags; elements are individual components of an HTML document and tags are written between angle brackets ( ie. <code>&#60;h1&#62;&#60;/h1&#62;</code> ).</p> 

            <p>By using the Treehouse coding tool Workspace, the content students create will never be released on the Internet. Students will only be able to view their code in the browser as long as the Workspace is open, once they close their workspace, the content becomes unavailable. Once the coding window is closed, the webpage will not exist on the internet.</p>

        <h4>Materials:</h4>
             <ol>
                <li>Computer or iPad - 1 per student</li>
                <li>Headphones - 1 per student </li>
                <li>Treehouse Account - 1 per student</li> 
                <li>Internet Connection</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Lesson Plan: Estimated time  ~ 60 minutes</h4>
        <article>
            <h5>1. Connection to prior-knowledge: 3 minutes</h5>
            <p>Ask the students how they have been taught to write a story. Example questions: “How do you format a piece of writing?” Write their responses on the whiteboard. Example responses:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Title in bold letters at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>Name and date in the upper right hand corner.</li>
                    <li>Align text on the left margin.</li> 
                    <li>Indent the beginning of each paragraph.</li>
                </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>2. Introduction to project: 2 minutes</h5>
            <p>Let the students know that after a 20 minute writing exercise, they are going to “publish the story on the internet” by creating a web page. To do this, they are going to use the computer language HTML. For this first lesson they will fill out an HTML template that has examples for where to put their title, author, and story in the HTML document. You can also let them know that there are comprehensive video lessons with detailed instructions.</p>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>3. Writing exercise: 20 minutes.</h5>
            <p>Stories should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title and author</li>
                <li>At least 2 paragraphs</li>
                <li>Students should write on a computer to expedite the next activity, however they can always rewrite their story into the Workspace.</li>
                <li>Choose a topic, theme, or allow the students to work freely.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>4. Coding exercise: 25 minutes</h5>
            <p>Opening computers, log on to Treehouse, and locate <em>Treehouse Club - HTML</em> lesson in the library.</p>
            <p>Project or individually watch the first video for <em>Publish a Story</em>.</p>
            <p>Have students open up the Workspace by clicking the button that says ‘Launch Workspace’ next to the video.</p>
            <p>Students edit the pre-written code in the Workspace with their title, author, and story.
            Remind students to save their work and preview it in the browser frequently during the editing process.</p> 
        </article>

        <article> 
            <h5>5. Share out: 10 minutes</h5>
            <p>Incentivize completion by scheduling time at the end of class for students to share what they have made with the class.</p>
            <p>This can be achieved in a number of ways. A few suggestions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Project projects at the front of the class.</li>
                <li>Gallery walk, where students leave their computers open and walk around the room.</li>
                <li>Table or pair share, where the students can talk about what they did in more depth with a smaller number of students.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <h4>Classroom Management:</h4>
        <ol> 
            <li>After 20 quiet minutes of writing, and the introductory video, allow students to walk around and help others.</li>
            <li>Publicly acknowledge students for knowing how to do different aspects of the project. This way students will know who to ask, when they have the same question.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Preview the next lesson “My First Web Page.”</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Not Enough Time:</h4>
        <ol> 
            <li>Have students write the story ahead of time and either email it to themselves, you, or rewrite it into Workspaces.</li>
            <li>Shorten the writing prompt.</li> 
            <li>Shorten sharing time by choosing the table or pair share option.</li>
